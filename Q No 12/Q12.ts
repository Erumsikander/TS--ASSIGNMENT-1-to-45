// Q12: Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

// Answer: 

let names: string[] = ["Salman", "Sharukh", "Hamza", "Ahmed", "Ali Raza"]

let message: string = "He Is My Brother";
console.log(names[0] + " " +message)
console.log(names[1] + " " +message)
console.log(names[2] + " " +message)
console.log(names[3] + " " +message)
console.log(names[4] + " " +message)
