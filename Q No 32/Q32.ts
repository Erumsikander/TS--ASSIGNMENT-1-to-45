// Q32: Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
// • Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
// • Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
// • Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
// • Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.

// Answer:

const currentUsers: string[] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"];
const newUsers: string[] = ["Bob", "Frank", "John", "Mallory", "Alice"];
function isUsernameTaken(username: string): boolean {
  return currentUsers.some((user) => user.toLowerCase() === username.toLowerCase());
}
for (const newUser of newUsers) {
  if (isUsernameTaken(newUser)) {
    console.log(`Sorry, the username '${newUser}' is already taken. Please choose a different one.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Congratulations! The username '${newUser}' is available.`);
  }
}
